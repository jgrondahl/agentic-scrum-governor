  story: Build a production-ready desktop tool that allows music producers to upload a reference track by a favorite producer alongside their own track and compare production quality, kick–snare relationship, and overall mix balance. The tool should provide objective analysis and actionable feedback, not just visualizations.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Users can upload both their track and a reference track for comparison.
  - The tool provides objective feedback on production quality, kick–snare relationship, and overall mix balance.
  - Feedback is actionable and can include suggestions for improvements.
  non_goals:
  - The tool will not perform automatic adjustments to user tracks.
  - The tool will not store any uploaded tracks permanently.
